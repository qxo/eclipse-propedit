However, you have to change the multi-byte character in a file into Unicode with the native2ascii tool of attachment in J2SDK on the character platform un-depending.\n\nThis editor can edit directly the property file written in the Unicode reference character, and saves the time and effort changed into Unicode by native2ascii. Moreover, in addition to the function of the usual editor, convenient functions, such as JBuilder and integration to Eclipse, are offered. In the integration to JBuilder and Eclipse, it is possible to open the properties file in a project directly and to edit it, and, of course, it is saved by Unicode.
